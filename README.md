# DBWKL (formerly DB2WKL)
The DB Workload Service (DBWKL) is a STAF service to create workload on databases. Compared to other workload generators this tool is a framework that provides an API for you to write your own workloads. DBWKL then provides you with flexibility, scalability and reliability during the workload runs.

DBWKL was originally developed to help with creating workload on a DB2 z/OS. The architecture was changed in a way that with some changes it can also run workload on any other database system.

# Setup
For now, the best way to setup DBWKL is to clone the repository and open the 4 projects in Eclipse. Run build_local_base.xml in the DB2WorkloadServiceDevBuild project after going through the steps mentioned in the readme.txt of the same project.

# Note
This project will undergo some changes in the future to be completely renamed to DBWKL. Additionally, the help will be migrated to be available on GitHub and sample workloads will be available as well.
